Yes, you can integrate Streamlit-Authenticator with third-party authentication providers to enhance your application's security and user experience. Here are some ways to achieve this:

## Integration Options

1. **Using OAuth2 with Third-Party Providers**:

   - You can use libraries like `streamlit-oauth` or `streamlit-google-auth` to integrate OAuth2 authentication directly into your Streamlit app. These libraries allow users to log in using their existing accounts from providers like Google, Facebook, or GitHub.

2. **Streamlit-Authenticator with OAuth**:

   - Streamlit-Authenticator can also be configured to work with third-party OAuth providers. This allows you to leverage existing authentication systems while maintaining the user management features provided by Streamlit-Authenticator.

3. **Descope for SSO and OAuth**:
   - Descope is another service that provides a comprehensive solution for integrating Single Sign-On (SSO) and OAuth social logins into your Streamlit app. It simplifies the setup process for using multiple authentication methods, including social logins.

## Example of Google Authentication Integration

Here’s a brief example of how you might set up Google authentication using the `streamlit-google-auth` package:

```python
import streamlit as st
from streamlit_google_auth import Authenticate

# Initialize the authenticator
authenticator = Authenticate(
    secret_credentials_path='google_credentials.json',
    cookie_name='my_cookie_name',
    cookie_key='this_is_secret',
    redirect_uri='http://localhost:8501'
)

# Check if the user is already authenticated
authenticator.check_authentification()

# Create the login button
authenticator.login()

if st.session_state['connected']:
    st.image(st.session_state['user_info'].get('picture'))
    st.write('Hello, ' + st.session_state['user_info'].get('name'))
    st.write('Your email is ' + st.session_state['user_info'].get('email'))

    if st.button('Log out'):
        authenticator.logout()
```

## Benefits of Using Third-Party Authentication

- **User Convenience**: Users can log in using existing accounts, reducing friction during the login process.
- **Enhanced Security**: Third-party providers often have robust security measures in place, which can enhance the overall security of your application.

- **Reduced Development Effort**: Implementing authentication through established providers can save time and effort compared to building a custom solution from scratch.

By integrating Streamlit-Authenticator with third-party authentication providers, you can create a more secure and user-friendly experience in your Streamlit applications.

To whitelist users in your Streamlit app using Google Authentication, you can implement a check after the user successfully logs in. This involves verifying the user's email against a predefined list of allowed emails. Here’s how to do it step-by-step:

## Step 1: Set Up Google OAuth

First, ensure that you have set up Google OAuth for your Streamlit app. You should have the necessary credentials (Client ID and Client Secret) and have configured the OAuth consent screen in the Google Cloud Console.

## Step 2: Define Whitelisted Users

Create a list of whitelisted user emails that are allowed to access your app. You can store this list in your code or in a separate configuration file.

```python
# List of whitelisted emails
WHITELISTED_USERS = [
    "user1@example.com",
    "user2@example.com",
    "user3@example.com"
]
```

## Step 3: Implement Google Authentication Logic

Use libraries such as `google-auth` to handle the authentication. Below is an example of how to implement this logic in your Streamlit app:

```python
import streamlit as st
from google.oauth2 import id_token
from google.auth.transport import requests

# Your Google Client ID
CLIENT_ID = "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID"

def authenticate_user():
    # Trigger Google login
    if st.button("Login with Google"):
        # Redirect user to Google's OAuth 2.0 server for authentication
        auth_url = f"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?client_id={CLIENT_ID}&redirect_uri=http://localhost:8501&response_type=code&scope=email"
        st.write(f'<a href="{auth_url}">Click here to login</a>', unsafe_allow_html=True)

    # After redirect, handle the response and get user info
    code = st.experimental_get_query_params().get('code')
    if code:
        try:
            # Exchange authorization code for an access token
            token = id_token.fetch_id_token(requests.Request(), code)
            email = token.get('email')

            # Check if the email is whitelisted
            if email in WHITELISTED_USERS:
                st.success(f"Welcome {email}!")
                return email
            else:
                st.error("You are not authorized to access this app.")
                return None

        except Exception as e:
            st.error(f"Authentication failed: {e}")
            return None

# Main application logic
def main():
    st.title("My Streamlit App")
    user_email = authenticate_user()

    if user_email:
        # Protected content goes here
        st.write("This is protected content only accessible to whitelisted users.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Explanation of Code Components

- **Whitelisted Users**: A list containing the emails of users who are allowed access.
- **Google Authentication**: The `authenticate_user` function handles the login process by redirecting users to Google's OAuth page.

- **Email Verification**: After obtaining the user's email from the token, it checks whether the email is in the `WHITELISTED_USERS` list.

- **Protected Content**: If the user is authenticated and their email is whitelisted, they can access protected content.

By following these steps, you can effectively restrict access to your Streamlit app, ensuring that only specific users can log in using Google Authentication.
